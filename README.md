- *NVDA+ALT+n*: Markdown to HTML conversion. The result is displayed in a virtual buffer of NVDA.
- *NVDA+ALT+k*: HTML to markdown conversion
- *NVDA+ALT+l*: MarkDown to HTML source conversion. The result is displayed in a virtual buffer of NVDA.
- *NVDA+SHIFT+h*: copy the HTML generated to the clipboard from a Markdown content. One press: copy as *plain text* (HTML source). Two quick presses: copy as *formatted HTML*.

*Notes*:
* The *formatted HTML* can be pasted in applications like Microsoft Word, Wordpad, Thunderbird, some rich-text field in web page, etc.. However it can't be pasted in text editor such as Notepad, Notepad++, etc..
* You can remap these gestures in the input gestures configuration, under _MarkDown Forever_ section.
* You should favor the display in browser instead of the virtual  buffer of NVDA. Some tags such as `<details>` are not supported by the render of virtual buffer.
